## P.2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
***Problem Statement***


Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two 
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

***Algorithm***

First we must realize that after 2, an even term will occur every third term in
the sequence. We can use some algebra to establish a subseries of the Fibonacci 
sequence dependent only on terms relative by multiples of 3. More specifically,

```math
F_{n} = 4F_{n-3} + F_{n-6}
```

So start at n = 8 or 34, the 3rd even number in the sequence, and generate every
even number of the sequence until we pass four million.
```c
f_n6 = 2;
f_n3 = 8;
f_n = 4*f_n3 + f_n6;
sum = 10;
while (f_n < ubound) {
    sum += f_n;
    f_n = 4*f_n3 + f_n6;
} return sum;
```
